While their stubby legs can support their body weight, Toydarians' primary mode of locomotion was their use of the wings on their upper back. Though their wings can beat as fast as ten times a second, the effort burned up large amounts of energy, causing the species to need to replenish itself often through regularly eating mass quantities of food. In order to fuel this hyperactive metabolism, Toydarians eat concentrated foods and egg-seeds. Most of the bloodiest wars in their history were fought over food supplies. </p><h2>Society and Culture</h2><p>Despite being ruled by the Hutts, the Toydarian people are able to govern themselves free of major outside intervention through the establishment of a feudal monarchy. A ruling king sits on the planet's throne, allowing vassals to form allegiances and have minor disputes to solve their own problems. The king makes sure to keep his vassals happy and to have their allegiance, but will occasionally encourage infighting to reveal the true character of the vassals and weed out treachery. \r\n\r\nToydarians are known as shrewd businessmen.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Toydarian names are fairly simple and guttural, but a few harsher elements can be found here and there.

The second is a limited telepathic ability, used to project emotions onto others, as well as allowing them to read and even feel the emotions of others; some Zeltrons have been hired by the Exchange for this ability. Because of their telepathic ability, positive emotions such as happiness, love and pleasure are very important to them, while negative ones such as anger, fear, or depression are shunned.</p><h2>Society and Culture</h2><p>Zeltron culture is highly influenced by sexuality and the pursuit of pleasure in general. Most of their art and literature is devoted to the subject, producing some of the raciest pieces in the galaxy. Zeltrons are known to dress in wildly colorful or revealing attire.

They have partially retractable eyestalks with nictitating membranes when underwater. Green eyes are unusual amongst Gungans.</p><h2>Society and Culture</h2><p>Gungans are generally a generous and peaceful species. They truly love to have visitors and warmly welcome them; however, they would remain suspicious until the visitors have earned their respect. Gungans are not tolerant of anyone who threatens their peaceful culture. They have very strict laws, and will go to the extremes to punish anyone who has committed a minor crime. Vandals, for example, can be given a sentence of exile, caning, or even stoning.\r\n\r\nIf a Gungan is cast out of society, it is very difficult for them to return. If they do manage to return legally, they are often subjected to heavy discrimination.

The most striking difference between balosars and humanity is a pair of antennapalps which sprouts from underneath the thick, coarse hair on their skulls. Retractable, these atennapalps allow them to listen into the subsonic range and give the species physical intuition and preternatural reflexes, which members of the Jedi Order sometimes mistook for Force sensitivity.

After its discovery, Balosar was wrought with corruption, addiction, and pollution from the production and usage of death sticks.

Electronic devices can also be sensed by Gotals; in fact, most droids give off enough electromagnetic emissions to at least annoy a Gotal, and at worst to seriously disorient the horned beings, making them notoriously distrustful of droids. Gotals rely heavily on their cones, with their eyesight and hearing being quite weak, and their sense of smell almost completely absent. </p><h2>Society and Culture</h2><p>Since their natural empathy makes them instantly sensitive to the feelings of others, Gotals have little use for government or laws on their homeworld, resulting in problems when dealing with other societies. No central authority figure can speak for Antar 4 as a whole in a crisis, and no organized Gotal military or police force can act on their behalf. Other species respect the Gotals for their discretion and restraint, but some individuals fear interacting with the horned beings for fear of having their emotional state revealed to others.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Gotal names are quite guttural, though there are also many harsher tones within their names.

Long forgotten and left to their own devices, these immense, force-sensitive brutes thrived and organized themselves into numerous clans or vrzaschri united by their natural adherence to the dark side but kept at odds by their desire for supremacy.

Bipedal with four additional arms, the Bartokk have a single primary hand, though they can handle weapons and tools with all four. When in a defensive stance, a Bartokk can crouch down on four legs and attack with the other two, flashing their razor-edged claws. Their primary eyes are located on their head, and are bright red in color. Additional eyes are located on their lower abdomen.</p><p>Via a hive mind, all Bartokk share a telepathic link to each other, sharing intelligence and thoughts within 1500 feet of each other. This ability also serves as a good defense from being flanked by predators. The Bartokk possess amazing regenerative abilities and can recover from almost any injury, so long as their brains are not completely destroyed. If their brain were cut in half, each half would regenerate into a separate twin, creating an entirely new individual. Severed parts of their bodies continue functioning normally for a short time. Even in the case of decapitation, the body would continue to fight, despite the lack of a head.</p><h2>Society and Culture</h2><p>The Bartokk hive mind organizes their society into a single cohesive facet of their personalities. Their unidentified homeworld is mildly radioactive, leading to occasional mutations which would seem minor to most beings but are grounds for exile in Bartokk society. The Bartokk remain mysterious and fearsome to other species familiar with the Bartokk assassin guilds. These guilds operate across the galaxy and frequently target political figures, using numbers to overwhelm the target's defensive forces after neutralizing major defense emplacements and communications first. Bartokk travel in hives of fifteen and are unrelenting in the pursuit of prey.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Bartokk typically do not take individualized names, being but one part of a larger collective identity.

This division has continued into modern times, with males continuing their nomadic traditions and females frequently preferring to stay in villages and cities.

Their pink skin is covered in fur that offers some protection from cold weather, but, more importantly, it serves as an olfactory organ, able to pick up scents at a distance and ascertain intrinsic details—such as penetrating through a disguise or identifying a forgery—when rubbed against. The species has both male and female sexes, although non-Squibs often have difficulty determining the sex of a Squib based on appearance alone. Their mouths are full of forbidding, sharp, white teeth, and their flexible cheeks were capable of storing items.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Squibs are friendly and cheerful to such an extent that, over time, they are considered quite annoying. Squibs are inherently curious, handling items with literal regard to care. They are unabashed pack rats, and they wear clothing for the excess storage rather than necessity. The Squibs' overconfidence is a defining trait. The typical Squib response to a threat is not to fight or flee, but to bluff and bluster, especially when not face-to-face. In person, their sharp teeth are their favored means of intimidation. Squibs believe that bargaining is the highest form of communication, and they believe haggling is more important than the goods themselves. A deal is a binding oath to Squibs, and they are incredibly loyal to their business partners.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Squibs combine their first and last names, which are familial, into one long, hyphenated name.

Females lack the superior cranial horns, but had more pronounced and longer posterior head plates; these can reach halfway down their back. Chagrians also have very long black forked tongues.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>As a species, Chagrians are generally peaceful and law-abiding to the point of becoming stoic and obstinate. Many Chagrians are motivated only by basic desires such as sustenance, shelter, and healthcare. Chagrian government ensures that every citizen is cared and provided for, so the standard of living for the poorest Chagrian is high compared to the members of other species. Chagrians who expect violence often wear red.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Chagrian names have a very melodic tone. Male names are typically shorter than female names.

This is not true for all, however, as some eschew the life of a decadent, obese version of their species and prefer a more mobile existence. Hutt society is divided into families known as kajidics, a social structure that is both familial and a crime gang. Hutts are encouraged to make a name for themselves around the age of 150 while simultaneously not threatening the welfare of the clan. At around 200, they will likely stop being saved by the clan and encouraged even further to fend for themselves while benefiting the kajidic; they may even be granted a star system or two.
